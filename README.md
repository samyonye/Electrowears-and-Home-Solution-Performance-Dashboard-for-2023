Introduction
The Electrowears and Home Solution Performance Dashboard for 2023 provides a comprehensive view of product and category performance across multiple dimensions - including price, ratings, manufacturing trends, warranty periods, and customer preferences.
With key products like smartphones, headphones, laptops, and monitors, and categories spanning electronics, clothing, and home appliances, this dashboard captures the dynamic nature of consumer demand and product performance. By analyzing the data holistically, we can identify top-performing products, customer behavior patterns, and potential areas for operational improvement.

Story of the Data
2023 was a revealing year for Electrowears. At the product level, the smartphone emerged as the clear market leader - commanding the highest price point (₦654,806.03) and the longest warranty period (5176 units). However, it was headphones that stood out as the most-rated product, slightly outperforming smartphones in customer feedback volume (2533 vs. 2531 ratings).
In terms of category performance, home appliances led the pack in both price (₦853,653.56) and customer perception, being crowned the best-performing category. Surprisingly though, clothing took the top spot by number of customer ratings (10,083) - showing that while it may have a lower price, it's highly engaged by users.
The manufacturing trend showed a decline in output over time - from 3446 units in January to 3260 in July, suggesting either a shift in demand, supply constraints, or a strategic production cut.
From a visual preference standpoint, the most purchased color-size combination was Red/Small, with a quantity of 169,945 units, just slightly ahead of Green/Large and Blue/Medium.
The product quantity data reinforces the dominance of smartphones (129,451 units sold), followed by headphones, laptops, and monitors. Despite slight differences in total price and warranty coverage, the high volume of smartphone purchases cements its place as the top product for the year.

DATA SPLITTING AND PREPROCESSING
DATA CLEANING: this is when the data is free from errors dataset ensures accuracy and reliability in analysis and which include;
Removing duplicates
Correcting errors
Standardizing data format
Data Transformations: Transformations were applied to prepare the data for better interpretation and analysis.
Data splitting: This involve the splitting of data point into two category independent and dependent variable.
· Independent variable are those variable that can stand alone i.e your name, and can still make meaning.
· Dependent variable are those variable that can't stand alone they won't make any meaning until they are attached to something e.g revenue, quantity.
